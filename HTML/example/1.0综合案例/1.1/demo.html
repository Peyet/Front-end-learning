    <h3 id=1.0>1.圣诞节的由来</h3>
    <p>Long time no see! This is a continuation of the cold introduction series. I’m sorry for the moronic title – it’s
    actually the co- version of “cold introduction”, I’ve first fliiped “introduction” to “conclusion”, and have
    taken away the “co-“ prefix of “cold” and “conclusion”, so it becomes “ld nclusion”.</p>

    Fortunately, this time we won’t need these complicated operations. We won’t need any SVG pictures either, because
    you’ve got enough of them (and should be able to draw them by yourself), and I’ve got enough with inkscape’s shitty
    display on hi-dpi screens!

    <h3>2.圣诞老人的由来</h3>

    <p>Why do I use such title? Well, because this time I wanna talk about codata and coinduction. So, basic knowledge
    on copatterns and productivity checking (guardedness) and Agda coinduction will be assumed. Links are pointed to
    the version v2.6.1 of the documentation.</p>

    <h3>3.圣诞树的由来</h3>

    <p>Recall the previous post, we have introduced the composition operation. It’s complicated, right? ;-)</p>
